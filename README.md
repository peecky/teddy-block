## How to ##
Move the figure below the Teddy. Make 4 contiguous figures with same shape and then they will be destroyed. There are three kinds of shapes. A figure is changed when it moves a cell and it becomes same shape when it returns the original cell.

Figures are randomly generated. If the game board is full of figures, the game is over. If the figure below the Teddy is destroyed, also, the game is over. Before the figure is destroyed, Teddy should move to another figure.
